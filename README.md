# THIS REPO IS UNMAINTAINED
That does not mean the project is deprecated, though...

pk-webs-beta, the svelte rewrite of this project, now lives on as the [official PluralKit dashboard](https://github.com/PluralKit/PluralKit/tree/main/dashboard)! Feel free to make contributions to the official PluralKit repository. All links to https://pk-webs.spectralitree.com should be redirecting to https://dash.pluralkit.me instead.

## pk-webs
A web interface for [pluralkit](https://pluralkit.me/).

### Please note:
This is a work in progress. The code is super messy, many features are not added yet, and I cannot guarantee that this is completely bugless. Feel free to open an issue if you notice anything wrong.
